## Introduction
TypeScript fundamentals, API consumption from Angular, building Apps using Firebase and CSS using Bootstrap.

Note I'm following an Udemy course, _"La Web Empieza Aquí: TypeScript, Angular , Storage, Firebase"_, by Tomás Garay. [Check it out](https://www.udemy.com/course/la-web-empieza-aqui-typescript-angular-storage-firebase/) (Spanish, 19 hours).

#### "[ejemplos/ejercicios](/ejemplos/ejercicios)" folder:
- **TypeScript** data types fundamentals.
- Note index.html scripts are commented out. Please uncomment them to see these TypeScript examples performance on console.

#### "[hola-mundo](hola-mundo)" folder:
- First app on **Angular**.
- Initial approach to components, property binding, two way binding, pipes, directives, models, routing...
- Please note some parts of app.component.html are commented out, so:
 1. You can uncomment these parts to see how they perform on home screen (not recommended).
 2. You can just navigate through them, because these very components has been used to simulate routing features (recommended).
 - Moreover, some other parts of code can be commented out. Because... you know, first app stuff :)
