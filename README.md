# TypeScrip, Angular, Firebase, Bootstrap
---
## Introduction
TypeScript fundamentals, API consumption from Angular, building Apps using Firebase and CSS using Bootstrap.

Note I'm following an Udemy course, _"La Web Empieza Aquí: TypeScript, Angular , Storage, Firebase"_, by Tomás Garay. [Check it out](https://www.udemy.com/course/la-web-empieza-aqui-typescript-angular-storage-firebase/) (Spanish, 19 hours). Course shows examples to explain TypeScript fundamentals, then explain Angular principles, and later uses those examples to build a more complex examples. The final objective is to build a big project (A Gym System).
